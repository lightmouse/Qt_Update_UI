On Dell Latitude 6410 running Windows XP, it's necessary to install
the registry setting found in PcmciaIrqRouteToPciController.reg.

Double-click on PcmciaIrqRouteToPciController.reg and answer Yes when
asked whether you want to add the information in the file to the
registry. Then restart the PC.
