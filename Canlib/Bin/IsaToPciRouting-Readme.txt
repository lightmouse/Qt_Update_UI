On certain computers it is necessary to run IsaToPciRoutingEnable.reg
to make a SwapBox CardBus adapter (with Ricoh controller) work with
Windows 2000.

You may want to consult with support@kvaser.com before running this
file.

You need to install the latest service pack for Windows 2000 at the
same time.

To run the file, just double-click on it in Windows Explorer. The
registry editor will launch automatically, ask for your permission
and then enter the data into the registry.
