<h1>Reading log events</h1>

<a href=".">VS2010 project</a>

<p>This program goes through all the log files in the device and saves their contents in plain text files.</p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>Like in the previous sample, we use <code>Initialize</code> to initialize Kvmlib and <code>DeviceOpen</code> to get a handle to the device.</p>

<h2>Reading log files</h2>
<p>The log files are mounted using <code>LogFileMount</code>. Here we need to supply the device handle, the index of the log file (starting from zero) and an integer where the number of events is saved.</p>

<p> Next, we use <code>LogFileReadEvent</code> to iterate through the events in the log file. This method gives us a <code>Log</code> object which contains all the information about the logged event. The method will return <code>kvmERR_NOLOGMSG</code> when the end of the log file is reached. This way, we can iterate through all the events by calling <code>LogFileReadEvent</code> until it returns an error. </p>

<h2>Getting info from log events</h2>
<p>The <code>Log</code> objects belong to one of three subclasses depending on the type of event: </p>

<ul>
  <li><code>LogMsg</code> for received CAN messages. These contain all the fields of a CAN message, as well the number of the receiving channel</li>
  <li><code>LogRtcClock</code> for clock messages. These contain the timestamp in seconds (<code>calendarTime</code>) and nanosecond (<code>timeStamp</code>).</li>
  <li> <code>LogTrigger</code> for trigger messages. These contain the type of the trigger, the pre- and post times, a timestamp and the type of trigger event.</li>
</ul>

<p> To write the messages to the file, we check which of these subclasses the <code>Log</code> object belongs to, and then construct a string from the values of this subclass.</p>
