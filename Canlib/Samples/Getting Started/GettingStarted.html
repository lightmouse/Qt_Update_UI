<h1>
Getting started with Canlib
</h1>

<p>To help you learn how to program with Canlib, we have included tutorials in C, C# and Java. These, along with the other samples should give you an idea of how to develop your own programs.</p>

<h2>The C# tutorial</h2>
<p>The <a href="CSharp/Tutorial.html">C# tutorial</a> is rather extensive. It covers everything from setting how to import Canlib to advanced database applications. </a>

<h2>The C tutorial</h2>
<p>The <a href="C/Tutorial.html">C tutorial</a> includes the first two steps of the C# tutorial, just to give an idea of how to use Canlib in C applications. C programmers can also refer to the C# tutorial since the Canlib calls are essentially the same. There are also a few other <a href="../Learn more/C/Readme.html">C samples</a> which might be interesting. </p>

<h2>The Java tutorial</h2>
<p>As a language, Java has a few small but important differences from C# in that it lacks some of the constructs used in the C# API. Furthermore, there is no official API for Java yet. However, we have included a package which uses JNA to access functionality from <code>canlib32.dll</code> as well as a wrapper to facilitate a more object oriented programming style. We have also translated the first three parts of the tutorial into Java.</p>

<p> <a href="Java/Readme.html">Java tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2>The Python tutorial</h2>
<p>A <a href="Python/Readme.html">tutorial</a> for Python programmers is available. Just like with Java, we have provided classes which wrap the calls to the libraries.</p>
