Canlib C# tutorial
</h1>

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>This tutorial is intended to help programmers who are new to programming with Canlib. In this series, we show some of Canlib's most important functions and teach you how to use them. </p>

<p>These projects are made in Visual Studio 2010. We have also made Visual Studio 2008 projects for the first three parts. Parts 4-8 involve components which require .NET version 4 or higher. </p>

<h3><a href="Preliminaries.html">Part 0: Preliminaries</a></h3>
<p>Some useful things to know before you start programming.</p>

<h3><a href="VS2010/1_HelloWorld/Readme.html">Part 1: Hello world!</a></h3>
<p>This first part will teach you how to open a channel, write a message to the channel, and close the channel.</p>

<h3><a href="VS2010/2_Candump/Readme.html">Part 2: Receiving messages</a></h3>
<p>In the second part, we show you how to wait for messages and read them.</p>

<h3><a href="VS2010/3_CanIoCtlDemo/Readme.html">Part 3: CanIoCtl</a></h3>
<p>The third part demonstrates the various functionalities of the <code>canIoCtl</code> call.</p>

<h3><a href="VS2010/4_WpfApplication/Readme.html">Part 4: A GUI application</a></h3>
<p>Here we demonstrate how you can create a graphical application which writes and sends messages. </p>

<h3><a href="VS2010/5_WpfAppEvents/Readme.html">Part 5: Events</a></h3>
This is a variation of the program part 4. It shows how to listen for messages on a channel by using event handles.</p>

<h3><a href="VS2010/6_DBApp/Readme.html">Part 6: Databases</a></h3>
<p>This sample demonstrates how you can use CAN databases in your applications. </p>

<h3><a href="VS2010/7_DBWpfApplication/Readme.html">Part 7: More databases</a></h3>
<p>A program which receives information, interprets it using a database and puts it into a chart. </p>

<h3><a href="VS2010/8_DBSendMessages/Readme.html">Part 8: Sending messages with databases</a></h3>
<p>This sample shows how you can take real world data, convert it into a CAN message and send it to the channel. </p>
