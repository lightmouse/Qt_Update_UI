<h1>LIN sample program</h1>

<a href=".">Source code</a>

<p>Simple test program for the LIN BUx.
Requires LAPcan + DRVLIN.
  Sends and receives messages.</p>

<p>linlib.dll must be somewhere in the path for the application to run.</p>

<p>The program is written in C and has been tested with Borland and Microsoft compilers.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
You may use one of the following flags:
<dl>
<dt>n</dt><dd>Where n is the channel number</dd>
<dt>-m</dt><dd>The channel is a master with this flag, without it is a slave</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example: <code>linTest 1 -m</code></p>
<p>Will go on bus with channel 1 as master</p>

<p>Run it in two different console windows:</p>


<p><code>  1) linTest 0 <br />
    2) linTest 1 -m</code></p>

<p>(1) will then operate as a slave on channel 0,
  and (2) will operate as a master on channel 1.</p>
