<p>This program demonstrates how to send periodic messages using object buffers.</p>

<h2>Building the sample program</h2>
<p>
Open the VBSample.vbproj file in Visual Studio.NET.
</p>
<p>
To be able to build the sample program you must make sure that the path to "canlibCLSNET.dll" in Visual Studio is correct. Do so by using:
Project->VBSample Properties->Common Properties->Reference Path
</p>
<p>
Remember to make sure canlibCLSNET.dll is somewhere in the path as it is required to run the application.
</p>
<p>
It is now posible to build the project by using: 
Build->Build solution</p>
<p>
You can now run the program by using:
</p>
<p>
Debug->Start
</p>

<h2>Testing the program</h2>

<p>
Choose a period for the messages and click on "Initialize Channel 0". Then, click "Update". This will make the object buffer transmit messages on Channel 0, with a bitrate of 250 kb/s. 
You can change the message at any time by modifying the parameters and pressing "Update". To change the period, you will need to first deactivate and then activate the channel.
</p>

<h2>Understanding the program</h2>
<p>When activating the channel, the program opens the channel, sets the bitrate and creates a new periodic object buffer with a call to <code>canObjBufAllocate</code>. It then takes the channel on bus. </p>

<p>The "Update" button sets period for the buffer with <code>canObjBufSetPeriod</code> and the message to be sent using <code>canObjBufWrite</code>. The first time it is pressed, it also enables the object buffer with a call to <code>canObjBufEnable</code>. 
</p>

<p>To stop the object buffer from transmitting, we call <code>canObjBufDisable</code>. This won't remove the object buffer completely. To do so, we use <code>canObjBufFree</code>.</p>
<p>Further information about the Canlib methods used can be found in the Object buffer section in the Canlib help file.</p>
