<h1>Serialization and deserialization</h1>

<a href=".">Source code</a>

<p>In the <a href="../3_FileIO_T/Readme.html">previous example</a>, we demonstrated how to perform file input and output in t. Here, we will do essentially the same thing, but we will use the serialization capabilities of t to make reading and writing a bit easier. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The program is used just like the previous one. The difference you will notice is that the messages are not stored in human-readable format, so when the program reads the output file, the output will look a bit strange.</p>

<h2>The C# program</h2>
<p>The C# part is identical to the previous example.</h2>

<h2>The t program</h2>
<p>The t program is almost identical to the one in the previous example. This section will only describe the differences.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Instead of an array of lines, we have an array of text blocks. Each of them are the size of a <code>CanMessage</code> structure. </p>

<h3>Processing incoming messages</h3>
<p>The <code>msg_to_str</code> has become simplified to just one line: we give the <code>char</code> array in the <code>MsgBlock</code> struct the value of the incoming <code>CanMessage</code>. This will serialize the <code>CanMessage</code> into a string. When we stop the script, we use <code>fileWriteBlock</code> to write the text blocks to the file. </p>

<h3>Reading messages</h3>
<p>The <code>read_messages</code> method is much simpler. Here, we just create a string with the size of a <code>CanMessage</code>, use <code>fileReadBlock</code> to read the input to it and then serialize it to a message. </p>
